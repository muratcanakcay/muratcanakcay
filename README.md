*There is really nothing you must be.*   
*And there is nothing you must do.*  
*There is really nothing you must have.*  
*And there is nothing you must know.*  
*There is really nothing you must become.*  
  
*However, it helps to understand that fire burns,*  
*and when it rains, the earth gets wet.*
