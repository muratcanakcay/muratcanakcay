*There is really nothing you __must__ be.*   
*And there is nothing you __must__ do.*  
*There is really nothing you __must__ have.*  
*And there is nothing you __must__ know.*  
*There is really nothing you __must__ become.*  
  
*However, it helps to understand that fire burns,*  
*and when it rains, the earth gets wet.*
